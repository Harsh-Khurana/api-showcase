*****NOTE*****

To test the app i recommend using live-server using npx or directly if you have it installed globally, becuase github.io page of this project might give cross-origion allow error,
and request to the jsonplaceholder api will not be executed.

About the project

It is a simple app that makes api calls for get and post and displays them in a nice aesthetic and in a well defined manner.
